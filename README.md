# Survey Text Analysis Tool 

A Python tool that ingests a survey CSV, translates open-text answers, uses an LLM to generate **themes**, assigns every response to a theme for **exact counts**, and produces **charts** and a **markdown report**. Data is stored in **SQLite** so runs are repeatable and auditable.

> Works great for customer, employee, or product feedback surveys with open-ended questions.
